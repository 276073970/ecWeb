# ecWeb
Our first electronic commerce website!

Please make a folder named ecWeb firstly in your working directory, then pull this project to you local repository. <br>
If you finish the steps above, just have fun with us! Come on! 

ATTENTION:
1. If you changed something, don't forget add some noets for it, please;
2. Maybe you can creat a .gitignore in your local working directory and write test.php in it, 
   so that you can do any test in the test.php which in you own local working directory and also you don't have to upload test.php when everytime you push your repo. 
3. You should config your local Apache server to make you web server root directory as ecWeb, and then just git init it as yuor working directory. By the way, don't forget creat a test.php for yourself.
